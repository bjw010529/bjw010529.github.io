Hello, welcome to my homepage! I am currently a PhD student in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE)](https://cse.umn.edu/isye) at [University of Minnesota Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). Prior to this, I was a Research Assistant II at the [Department of Mathematics](https://hkumath.hku.hk/web/index.php), [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) and lucky to work with Dr. [Yue Xie](https://yue-xie.github.io/). I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

My current research interests are continuous optimization, stochastic optimization, bilevel optimization as well as optimization problems arising in machine learning, operation research, and reinforcement learning. I am also interested in theory of machine learning and reinforcement learning more recently.

Other parts are under construction right now. Sorry for the inconvenience.
