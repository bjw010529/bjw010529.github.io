(For test now.) Hello, welcome to my homepage! I am currently a Research Assistant II at the [Department of Mathematics](https://hkumath.hku.hk/web/index.php), [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) and lucky to work with Dr. [Yue Xie](https://yue-xie.github.io/). Also starting in the fall of 2024, I will be a PhD candidate in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE)](https://cse.umn.edu/isye) at [University of Minnesota Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). Prior to this, I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

My current research interests are optimization problems arising in machine learning, operation research and other applications. I am also interested in theory of machine learning, quantum computing and statistical arbitage in general.
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
