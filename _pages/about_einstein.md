Hello, welcome to my homepage! I am currently a Research Assistant II at the [Department of Mathematics](https://hkumath.hku.hk/web/index.php), [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) and lucky to work with Dr. [Yue Xie](https://yue-xie.github.io/). Also starting in the fall of 2024, I will be a PhD candidate in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE)](https://cse.umn.edu/isye) at [University of Minnesota Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). Prior to this, I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

My current research interests are optimization problems arising in machine learning, operation research and other applications. I am also interested in theory of machine learning, quantum computing and statistical arbitage in general.
