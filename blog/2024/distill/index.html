These problems contain two levels of optimization tasks where one optimization task is nested within the other. They are called <strong>Upper Level</strong> problem and <strong>Lower Level</strong> problem, respectively.<d-footnote>Footnote for test.</d-footnote></p> <p>The bilevel optimization problem can be expressed as a constrained optimization problem as follows:</p> \[\min_{x \in X, y \in Y} F(x, y) \qquad \text{s.t.} \qquad y \in S(x)\] <p>where \(S(x)\) denotes the set of optimal solutions for the constrained Lower Level problem</p> \[\min_{y \in Y} f(x, y) \qquad \text{s.t.} \qquad g(x, y)\le 0\] <hr> <h2 id="classical-approaches">Classical Approaches</h2> <h3 id="single-level-reduction">Single-level Reduction</h3> <h3 id="penalty-function-methods">Penalty Function Methods</h3> <p>Penalty function methods deal with the bilevel optimization problems by adding penalty terms that measure the extent of violation of the constraints. The idea is trivial in optimization, but the bilevel hierarchy was still maintained and the reduced problem was still difficult to solve.</p> <p>In <d-cite key="ishizuka1992double"></d-cite>, the problem is reduced into a single level problem by replacing penalty term with its KKT conditions. Also, there are many ways to set penalty. For instance, in <d-cite key="yao2024constrained, lu2024first"></d-cite> they consider using penalty term to convert bilevel optimization problems to minimax problems.<d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite></p> <h3 id="trust-region-methods">Trust-region Methods</h3> <p>Not interested right now</p> <hr> <h2 id="moreau-envelope-for-bilevel-optimization">Moreau Envelope for bilevel optimization</h2> <p>For test.</p> </body></html>
