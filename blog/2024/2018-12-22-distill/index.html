You just need to surround your math expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code>, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$ E = mc^2 $$</code>. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like \(E = mc^2\).</p> <p>To use display mode, again surround your expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code> and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:</p> \[\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)\] <p>Note that MathJax 3 is <a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a major re-write of MathJax</a> that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now <a href="http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">on par with KaTeX</a>.</p> <hr> <h2 id="classical-approaches">Classical Approaches</h2> <p>Given the difficult nature of bilevel problems, it is not surprising that much of the classical literature considers bilevel problems that are mathematically well-behaved; i.e., contains functions that are linear, quadratic or convex. Strong assumptions like continuous differentiability and lower semi- continuity are quite common.</p> <h3 id="single-level-reduction">Single-level Reduction</h3> <p>In <d-cite key="ishizuka1992double"></d-cite>, the problem is reduced into a single level problem by replacing penalty term with its KKT conditions. Also, there are many ways to set penalty.</p> <p>For instance, in <d-cite key="yao2024constrained, lu2024first"></d-cite> they consider using penalty term to convert bilevel optimization problems to minimax problems.</p> <h3 id="penalty-function-methods">Penalty Function Methods</h3> <p>Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.</p> <h3 id="trust-region-methods">Trust-region Methods</h3> <p>However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.</p> <hr> <h2 id="moreau-envelope-for-bilevel-optimization">Moreau Envelope for bilevel optimization</h2> <p>Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-footnote&gt;</code> tag. The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote></p> </body></html>
