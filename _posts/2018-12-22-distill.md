## Bilevel Optimization

First, about bilevel optimization.

The bilevel optimization problem can be expressed as a constrained optimization problem as follows:

$$
\min_{x \in X, y \in Y} F(x, y) \qquad \text{s.t.} \qquad y \in S(x)
$$

where $$ S(x) $$ denotes the set of optimal solutions for the constrained Lower Level problem 

$$
\min_{y \in Y} f(x, y) \qquad \text{s.t.} \qquad g(x, y)\le 0
$$

## Penalty Function Methods

Penalty function methods deal with the bilevel optimization problems by adding penalty terms that measure the extent of violation of the constraints.
The idea is trivial in optimization, but the bilevel hierarchy was still maintained and the reduced problem was still difficult to solve.

In <d-cite key = "ishizuka1992double"></d-cite>, the problem is reduced into a single level problem by replacing penalty term with its KKT conditions.


This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine.
You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`.
If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph.
Here is an example:

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$
